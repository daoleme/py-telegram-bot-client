Telegram BOT Client
=====
A telegram bot API client is written in python3.5+ and currently compatible with Telegram Bot API v5.1 and later.

The reason for writing this bot utility is that I wish to run multi telegram bots which could have same or different business logic in one process . I reckon it is lightweight, fast, full implement and only urllib3 dependent.

This is a echo bot
--------

	from telegrambotclient import bot_client
	from telegrambotclient.base import MessageField, ParseMode

	# define a unnamed router
	router = bot_client.router()
	# define a bot with the router
	my_bot = bot_client.create_bot(token=<BOT_TOKEN>, router=router)
	# delete webhook if did or not
	my_bot.delete_webhook(drop_pending_updates=True)

	# decorate a handler callback on incoming message updates that have a text field
	@router.message_handler(fields=MessageField.TEXT)
	def on_echo_text(bot, message):
	    # receive and reply
	    sent_message = bot.send_message(
		        chat_id=message.chat.id,
		        text="I receive: <strong>{0}</strong>".format(message.text),
		        parse_mode=ParseMode.HTML,
		    )
	    # pin the sent message
	    bot.pin_chat_message(chat_id=message.chat.id, message_id=sent_message.message_id)

	# run polling to fetch updates in every 10s
	my_bot.run_polling(timeout=10)
